Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Pictured: Why you can't afford a gaming PC anymore.	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	People don't care about the environment at all. I'd vote to ban this kind of operation. But it seems responsible governments don't understand this kind of stuff yet to take proper actions.	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	I really hope the future of cryptocurrency moves to proof-of-stake rather than proof-of-work models. Just think of what all that energy and computer power could be used to accomplish rather than solving random useless problems.	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	I can't imagine how you'd do it. But it would be interesting to use the heat from this to fuel some kind of tropical garden or gardening in general.	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	what a bubble!!	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Cool video. Now I want a mining rig	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Have to say wasn't expecting people being so angry here. Like, this is a technology/computer channel...this is where content like this goes!	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Each kind of "coin" has a limited amount in order to prevent inflation.

But there are an infinity of different coins...	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	What a waste of power and resources,  shameful greed!	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	please could you make a small bitcoin donation too? ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜”19xkyksXX1dBfmFWCqkK2vz7RjjGNdKdYA	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	The greed of these people is insufferable. When you confront them with their greed you get a generic "It's the future of currency" excuse.. People are only trading and mining this stuff because it earns them money, like trading stocks. It's all about money, it's all about greed.	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Personally, I can't wait until this crypto-mining garbage fad goes the way of the dinosaur.	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Why give these racketeers this attention? These people are not our friends nor do they contribute anything net-positive to reality. This is a highly unethical plug for the most ecological and economical con-job in our history at a time where both those "disciplines" should ideally be pointed the exact opposite direction.

Shame on you.. Shame.	0

Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	I'm literally cringing looking at those rgb cards.. Meanwhile I spend 800 bucks for a 1080	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Who benefits from all this energy usage? Not the public surely as these alt coins are not ubiquitous for daily transactions. All of this benefit a small number of individuals gaming the market. 

Privatized gains, socialized losses.	1
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	If only they didn't use the same cards as everyday consumers use for gaming and graphics. ðŸ˜•	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	How much profit would these guys make yearly?	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Can I have one of those 1080 Ti's please? They are really too expensive on the market right now.	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Here is the reason you don't get to play PC games anymore - these things used to be called "Graphics Cards" and were manufactured for such ... oh well, there will be a great seconds market when this coin fad goes bust. Not that I can plug one of these into my mac... and my PC still uses AGP graphics (probably nearing upgrade time)	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Reminder: cryptocurrencies are more important than their energy expenses.	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	The irony of being baffled by heatwaves while you're expending 15 kilowatts around the clock to line your pockets is beyond me.	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	The greatest Ponzi scheme in history. Don't encourage their behavior.	2
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Does security have a price? Surely.
Is it worth all this energy? Certainly not.	1
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	I hope the bubble keeps exploding.	1
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Excellent video! I enjoyed the walk through. The guy running the rigs was interesting. I liked that he was a smaller outfit just making it work with what they had (filing cabinet, car fans...).	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Not going to dislike the video, because I like Computerfile, but I do really dislike crypto miners driving up electronics prices, wasting electricity and (talking specifically about mining "factories" in China etc. running directly on coal plants) ruining the environment.	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	GPU miners are mostly idiots. and he uses nicehash... noob. i'm sure he relies on online calculators not his own simulator. don't judge this guy for a pro, he is not.	1
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Let's say you lived in a northern climate and needed to heat your house anyway.  If you chose this method, over using a furnace that burns natural gas for instance, would it be feasible?  I'd rather make money to heat my house than pay money to do the same.  AND if I can expense the most pricey items of a gaming computer and/or dedicated server while I'm at it, even better.	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Is crypto currency and mining still worth a video (and the energy)?	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	So on average how profitable is a setup like that? Or in other words whats the typical startup and maintenance costs of a similar rig, and how long does it take of constant running to pay for those costs	1
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	I was hoping the rise of crypto currencies would dramatically accelerate the deterioration of the global economy such that it would have crashed by now. Guess Iâ€™ll have to wait a bit longer then. It will probably be the banks again anyway.	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Its always interesting to see the operations people have set up. I think everyone here wishes there was a better way for cryptocurrency to work though	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	I appreciate the look into the world of altcoin mining, even if I disagree with the practice. Will there be a follow-up to this video?	2
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Every once in a while I wish people actually did some research before stating their biased ungrounded opinions.	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	This is the work of the Devil.....	1
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	And computer games are not a waste, lol the hypocrisy here. Games add value to society in the form of entertainment. This protects the digital, resilient, uncensorable, impossible to counterfeit money.	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	I wonder if some research institution creates a coin that can be used to compute simulations. Then every so often have forks created to update the algorithm so that new simulation can be produced. Rewards should be spread equally amongst all participants similar to the p2pool concept. Considering gpu can switch between algorithms then that would be a great way to harness the crypto mining power network for research.	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Pathetic, people are downvoting this video just because they are butthurt about inflated prices of GPUs.	3
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Your UK heatwave would be just an ordinary summer in mid-europe, complain about it when it's 30Â°C at sunset.	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	"the summer we're having this year wasn't on our cards" B'dum-tish!	0

Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	No people, don't heat your homes with electricity, it's environmentally unfriendly.	1
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	So how much is this making? I assume it is going to charity.	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	this guy's a greedy capitalist scumbag profiting from wasteful currency speculation while in the meantime making graphics cards unobtainable and wasting massive amounts of electricity. absolute pissbag, and i'm very angry you're featuring people like this on your channel.	2
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	A Pi for fan control? Seriously, that's overkill. You could do that better with an arduino.	3
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Oy, my i7 and 2 980ti cards make my room 5-10 degrees hotter than anywhere else, and our AC is broken, so it's been almost 40 C in my room for months now... I can't imagine what it would be like with that many GPUs pumping heat out constantly.	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Computerphile: You're being down-voted based on the perception of what the person is doing, and not the information contained within the video. Keep that in mind :)	151
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Say, I wonder what a heat pump would do to that setup...?	0

Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	If only all that compute power wasn't going to waste. All the research we could support...	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Should run this only in the winter and use the waste heat from the cards to heat your house and water.	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	2:08 1080Ti's do up to 250W at full load and 100% power limit. No miner runs their cards at 100% power limit, usually between 70-90% as it makes almost no difference to hashrate with most algorithms and drops the power usage considerably. A 1080Ti will normally be using somewhere between 140-220W on most algorithms at 70-90% power usage.	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Cue the mad gamers mass-downvoting the video.	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	this person is making a buttload of money by doing NOTHING for his community, nation, or people. This is the ultimate form of "Pay for no work"
And it's absolutely disgusting	3
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	United American Corp(UAMA) has the best minning rigs i've seen,it even converts the heat into reneable energy way more efficient than this rig in the video.	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	So basically a crypto "coin" is a token of spent electricity?	1
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Stop ruining the GPU market.	1

Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Thank you for giving me a face I can visualize whenever I want to punch the idiots who buy up all the GPUs and drive up the prices.	8
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	There's an economic bubble concerning the price of very large integers.	4
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	0:43 he got PCIe slots and lanes backwards.	1
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Oh man you probably won't like comments.	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Do you convert altcoins to FIATs on the fly, or do you keep whatever you mined, and hope for the best?	4
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Why use GPU and not CPU?	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	WHAT DID YOU SAY!?!?!? I CANT HEAR YOU	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Ah yes, thank you for ruining the GPU market for everyone.	6
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Nice setup but the ignorance level is strong about crypto here (comments).	10
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	I do hope *-coins will end up being illegalized someday. Not that I wish anything bad on the miners, but it's literally wasting electricity for a tiny chance to get rewarded an electronic token you can exchange for real money (but won't because you want to increase the value of your token through speculation).	10
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	So how profitable is this, exactly?	2
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	How much would he make per year?	1
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Are they selling the coins as soon as they mine them? If so, it's a shame if some of them go nuts during a bubbl...I mean good times!	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Aren't the cards bottlenecked, because of the 1x PCIE link?	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Would that be good for 3d rendering?	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	What do you do with alt coins?  Like who actually accepts them as a form of currency? How are they worth all this effort?	1
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	They must be destroyed.	4
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	How many 1080ti's would need to be running in the UK to raise the ambient temperature by 15* Celcius?	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	But will it run Crysis?	8
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	.... but why.	1
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	I almost feel like creating a mining rig for the winter now, though it would take too much of my time. It would be a fun experiment. Perhaps you could create a thermostat that turns the GPUs on and off to reach a desired room temperature. It would likely be very noisy though.	0
Inside a Crypto-Mining Operation - Computerphile	Them bunch of cocks taking all cards.	1
