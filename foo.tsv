Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	HA HA! Video streaming issues right now, wish I could watch this.  Why don't companies hire managers who know what they are doing? First rule, don't beta test on customers, if something works well don't break it, your changes probably aren't as clever as you believe.	0
Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	There really needs to be an internet streaming protocol that routers can also make smart use of. Let's say a neighbourhood is watching the same stream, why send the package n * number of devices streaming?	0
Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	During this World Cup it happened a lot. Aerial SD was first, then aerial HD, then cable and last HD satellite. The delay could be from one second to five, so your low budget neighbor would spoil all the goals to the entire neighborhood.	1
Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	I'd love to know how sites like YouTube keep up with the MASSIVE demand for storage space. Surely they'd just be adding multiple HDDs each second with the insane amount of data, right? How is this sustainable at all? I've always wondered how these sites keep up with the demand, especially when they have no automatic timed deletion.	0
Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	Hey Computerphile, great video!  Could you do a follow up on streaming via platforms such as Twitch?  They allow individuals to stream from their home computer with a delay to the viewer of only a couple seconds.  It would be interesting to hear discussion on why there's so little delay on a user-generated platform vs big broadcasters.  I would assume its partially because the user isn't starting with a broadcast camera outputting 1Gbit/sec of data.	0

Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	Seems that home routers ought to become a termination point for the multi cast, and they should pass or deny it depending if a client on their network is requesting it - I know this is against the ethos of multi cast, but otherwise everybody's wifi networks will be blasting out 1000+ streaming channels constantly.  An different solution would be to have routers with Digital TV tuners built in, that when you go to a streaming website, the script on the page says what channel, and the router just magically inserts the video stream onto the web page.	0
Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	In 4:20 about waiting for all 12 frames, can't server just send "changes" of frames? No 0.5s delay then. Or receiving pcs can't "dynamically" decompress?	0

Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	There is only single stream that needs live broadcasting: sports matches. Because your neighbour will yell GOAL before you will see goal on the screen - and this is big deal for sport fans. For everything else latency does not matter. That being said it is still interesting problem to solve.	4

Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	FYI @Wimbledon for your example, the pictures (once recieved in the Broadcast trucks/media centre) are converted to an IP format (ST2110) before getting to the vision mixers.  The whole video plant at Wimbledon is using 2110 so 1080i video (all except Centre Court which is 4k) is at about 1.1Gbps as 2110 leaves just the video and other meets days is carried in a separate flow	0
Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	I often watch baseball games on TV, but listen to them on the radio, because the TV broadcast is being done by, say, some network that uses its own team of play-by-play announcers, but I want to hear the people who "belong" to my team.  Because of network TV contracts, the team's people can't be on the TV broadcast, so they broadcast locally on the radio.  And going back as far as I can remember -- even during the days of analog TV -- the radio was *always* a bit ahead of the TV broadcast.  So there must've been some kind of processing going on for the TV to make it not *quite* instantaneous?  It wasn't a *big* difference -- maybe 500 milliseconds or so.  But enough that you'd hear the crack of the bat just before seeing it on the TV.  In today's digital world, the difference is *far* worse -- the radio can be 5 or even 10 seconds ahead of the TV broadcast.  It gets very annoying sometimes.	0

Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	I'd love to know what goes on behind the scenes on the UK Parliament website which while providing live video, also builds an index/archive as it goes that seems as inviolable as Hansard. It seems unparralled compared with any other live streaming I've seen.	1
Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	Multicast doesn’t allow rewind, you’d need a separate stream for that.. But presumably DASH is better for that so long as your ISP has buffered the http file locally?	0

Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	Live broadcast is a serious topic on its own, that seems to be obsolete if not hardly ever holdable and not much notecable any more. Deligthful video about a for me personelly completely underestimated topic.	0
Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	The delay still seems pretty excessive though	2
Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	I was wondering about this a few weeks ago when I watched the World Cup on my TV and computer simultaneously and saw the almost 2 minute delay. I had previously noticed that there was a delay, but never 2 min! Thanks for the video.	0
Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	Seems to me like all this technological 'progress' has brought us systems that are outrageously more complex, more fragile, and more quirky - basically the complete opposite features of what is thought of as a high quality machine.	0

Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	1800hp class engine on a pit mining diesel truck, tonka truck variety makes you feel like midget, is expending energy at a megawatt at moderate-high load , more or less. They say 32Twh for buttcoin, I think real mining can keep up with that, beat it if we can into space.	0

Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	Great video, got reminded of the madness :D	0
Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	I have to say the explanation of streaming and what introduces delay was very good, but I dislike that the example with the BBC iPlayer you used indicated that every stream on the Internet has a massive delay of around 90 seconds.  That is very clearly not the case when looking at livestreams on sites like youtube, twitch or mixer. All those have a massivly lower delay on a decent internet connection unless they are set up to have more delay. Mixer even has a protocol they call FTL that allows for delay of less than a second if you have a good internet connection.  Hope I could clear things up for some people, as that was really the only part in this Video that was not great, but a bit misleading.	1

Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	So even with the latest tech.... Musicians around the world in different locations cannot play together.  Shame... I remember simotanious broadcast many years ago where BBC 2 could broadcast a music concert on Television while simotaniously broadcasting high quality stereo audio on FM BBC 3 radio.  These days we just get internet live stream HD pictures with poor audio that is highly compressed.  So much for advancements.	11

Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	The problem in the supposition that this number will continue to grow is that technology is not static. Miners are coming out every few months that are faster, more power efficient, or both. Also there are hundreds of different crypto currencies, and as their difficulty level rises, many people tend to move off one, and move to another. Some cryptos work on algorithms which are much more energy efficient. There is no doubt a lot of energy used, but when compared to how much is used for completely frivolous activities (like video gaming) I would bet it pales in comparison.	0
Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	Easy solution to the stop-button problem:  Press the button once and it shuts down the robot, press it twice and it gives the robot a huge points reward:  Press button twice - 1,000,000 points Make cup of tea - 10 points Press button once - 0 points  You can use the double press at the end of the day to show you're satisfied with its behaviour that day. It cannot intimidate you into pressing the button as then you'd just press it once and it would get 0 points. On the other hand it has to leave the button open as there's a chance it gets 1,000,000 points from this.  It maximises its points by doing all the things you want it to while leaving the stop button accessible. Job done.	1

Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	who cares ?	0
Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	Wow, serious details, thanks.	0
Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	Easy. If you press the button once the robot shuts down. If you press it twice the robot gets a very high utility. If you press it just once it gets low utility:  Button press twice = 1,000,000 points Cup of tea = 10 points Button press once = 0 points  You can use the double press at the end of the day if satisfied with the robot for the day. It will always leave the button available because of the chance of this. But, if you press it out of fear, then it shuts down and you don't press it a second time. The robot is now incentivised to leave the button accessible but also do only things you want it to do for the day.	1
Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	Daylight saving time. Every state in the USA observes it. Hawaii calls. Arizona calls. We don’t observe it. Ok but the entire state by law has to do the same thing. Then calls Navajo Nation. We are in Arizona but we do do daylight saving time. Then the Apache Nation calls. We are inside Navajo Nation who are inside Arizona and we don’t observe Daylight saving time.	0
Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	Why "this video is going to be a bit mathie" sounds so apologetic in every video I see on Youtube. If you don't love math/ can't do math then fields like Neural Networks etc. are not for you. You will never be at the bleeding edge of these fields without a firm understanding of maths.	0

Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	About a year ago, I had a great Fibonacci sequence idea, which I call Fibinary notation. It turns out (not too unexpectedly) that not only was I not the first to think of the idea, I also wasn't the first to think of the name.  If D is a sequence of binary digits (i.e. D_i = 0 or 1 for all i) then we can interpret it as an integer by value = Sum_i D_i F_{i+1}. (Smallest index is 1.) Compare to binary notation, where value = Sum_i D_i 2^{i-1}. (When we write D as a string of digits, we write it from highest index on left to lowest index on right.)  One interesting outcome is that Fibinary notation is not always unique, e.g. 100 = 3, but 011=3 also. In fact, anywhere in the sequence you see '011', you can substitute '100' without changing the value (and vice versa.) I call it canonical form when there are no adjacent 1s.   It isn't too hard to come up with an addition algorithm, although it would be hard to efficiently implement in logic gates because you don't know how many times you need to do 011 -> 100 substitutions. I looked at multiplication, threw up my hands in horror, and tried no further.  Web search for 'fibinary' to find out more. There is also an academic paper on a generalization of fibinary notation, the citation to which I don't have on hand (as I recall, it did not use the name 'fibinary').	0

Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	This is just... Not true.  I mean, it's true for exactly unstyled paragraphs that nesting or sequencing look alike. But that's a case that rarely occurs in the real world... Nesting anything with margin, padding, borders, transparent backgrounds, ... will not behave the same way.  It is not HTML "fixing it". The DOM created by his two examples with paragraphs will not be the same.  Overall I'm sad that he consolidates "errors" with just "syntax errors", which is not just simplistic, but plain wrong and not in accordance with how programming errors are treated in academia. What about all the errors that are not typos, that are syntactically correct but give a result other than the intended?	0
Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	U saved me 3 hours before my exam! Thanks	0
Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	Hmm, this doesn't allow recursion, but it DOES mean you can have subroutines that link in to _other_ subroutines themselves, possibly setting up whole context changes, _without needing a stack or stack pointer,_ which is a pretty neat trick in terms of saving both registers and memory space (as the stack swallows up quite a lot of bytes for each level of recursion or other nesting...)	0
Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	6:45 ... well, I'd probably start with spotting how it's supposed to be altering location 540, but instead it's writing to 561. That's probably not going to go well. Though it is of course rather easier to spot faults in self-modifying code when you've got a nice colourful animation to make it obvious...	0

Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	MS-DOS has had Unix-style input/output redirection in its shell since version 1.0 (1981) - that's four years before the first version of "GUI" Windows (Windows 1.0, 1985), and 12 years before the first version of Windows as an OS (Windows NT 3.1, 1993). Thus, redirection wasn't "retrofitted" into Windows - it was built-in from the start. MS-DOS and Windows is more Unix-like than most people realize (which is reasonable, since Microsoft was a vendor of Unix back in the 80s - they made and sold Xenix for the IBM PC).	0

Video Streaming Problems - Computerphile	It's insane that gamers think they have any sort of entitlement to graphics cards. A GPU is an SIMD expansion card with a plethora of use cases, gaming being just one of them. Everyone has the same entitlement to one and, if demand becomes too high, the market will adjust. This works in exactly the same way for any other product.	4
