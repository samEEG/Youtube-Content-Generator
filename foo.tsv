NVidia TensorRT: high-performance deep learning inference accelerator	Would you consider stepping through a couple of example codes in future interview like this? Much appreciated	3
NVidia TensorRT: high-performance deep learning inference accelerator	This is what i'm saying. Nobody cares about the interviews. Do some technical stuff.	1
At the intersection of TensorFlow & nuclear physics	As a physicist, I am pleased to see TF being useful for simulations, inverse problems, and processing experimental data - it's not just for NNs and such.	0
At the intersection of TensorFlow & nuclear physics	After watching the first 2 min. I guess you need to answer the question Why? does the process want to Self-Stop. Since it makes sense to a network.	0
